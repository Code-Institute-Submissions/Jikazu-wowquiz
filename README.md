The development environment used for this project was GitPod. To track the development stage and handle version control I've done regular commits and pushes sto GitHub. The GitPod environment was created by using a template provided by Code Institute. 

The live version of the project is deployed at GitHub pages.

The procedure for deployment followed the "Creating your site" steps provided in [GitHub Docs.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
